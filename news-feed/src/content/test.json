      "title": "The 7 Leading Trends Influencing SaaS Security in 2024",
      "article": "SaaS applications have become increasingly important for organizations globally, with approximately 70% of software for non-service companies like manufacturers and retailers hosted in the cloud. However, this shift has brought about unique security challenges. Key trends that will impact SaaS security in 2024 include increasing reliance on Identity Threat Detection & Response (ITDR), dealing with geo-specific tenants in response to varied regulatory requirements, addressing the risk from widespread misconfigurations, managing the threat from third-party applications, and mitigating security risks from remote/hybrid working. \n\nNew approaches are needed from security teams, who need tools for visibility and guidance into application settings to comprehend the associated risks and outcomes. ITDR will play a crucial role, detecting irregularities in user activity and sending alerts to prevent unauthorized access and data leakage. \n\nMoreover, the increasing complexity of regulatory requirements will result in a surge in geo-specific tenants, with each needing individual configuration. The report also stresses the growing risk from software misconfigurations, emphasizing the importance of automated checks and settings adjustments to avoid potential data leaks. \n\nAdditionally, the use of third-party applications poses a significant risk, with many requesting high-risk permissions that can compromise SaaS application security. The rise of remote and hybrid working exacerbates these concerns as users frequently access work accounts from personal devices that may not be adequately secured.\n\nThe report concludes by highlighting the utility of SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) tools such as Adaptive Shield in handling these challenges. These tools monitor configurations for anomalies, which helps maintain a robust security posture, manage third-party applications, and enable easy collaboration between business units and security personnel. An increasing number of companies are investing in SSPM tools, with about 80% already using SSPM or planning to do so within the next 18 months.",

      "article": "The Rhadamanthys information-stealing malware is evolving, with developers expanding its data-gathering capabilities and making it more customizable. This increases its threat level by meeting bespoke distributor needs, according to cybersecurity company Check Point. The malware, first documented by ThreatMon in October 2022, has been marketed as a service since September of the same year, typically spread through fake websites resembling legitimate software sites. It is able to gather various types of sensitive information from web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, email clients, VPNs, and instant messaging applications. \n\nThe Check Point investigation reveals similarities in design and implementation with the Hidden Bee coin miner. The most recent version of Rhadamanthys includes a new plugin system, making it more adaptable and customizable, and it contains both active components, which launch processes and inject additional payloads to aid data theft, and passive components, designed to find and parse specific files for saved credentials. The use of a Lua script runner can load up to 100 scripts to extract as much data as possible from various sources.\u00a0\n",

      "article": "The low-code/no-code (LCNC) and robotic process automation (RPA) tools, that enable rapid app development, have become a security concern. While they increase business efficiency and agility, the fast pace of LCNC development complicates the job of security professionals. Typically, security is viewed as hindrance in fast digital transition, contributing to many LCNC apps being left vulnerable to the same risks as traditionally developed programs. Current application security stacks are insufficient for safeguarding data and assets exposed by LCNC apps, leaving organisations with slow, manual security processes. To manage the unique challenges of LCNC and RPA environments, Nokod Security proposes a four-step process to introduce into LCNC app development. The Nokod platform offers a central security solution, managing cybersecurity and compliance risks throughout the app life cycle. It is clear that the expanding attack surface, brought about by the widespread adoption of LCNC and RPA platforms, represents a significant risk to businesses, demanding dedicated security solutions.",

      "article": "Two severe security flaws in Microsoft Windows, patched now, could have let hackers carry out cyber-attacks without any action from the user. Akamai security researcher, Ben Barnea, who discovered the vulnerabilities, said they could be chained for a full, zero-click remote code execution (RCE) exploit against Outlook clients. The flaws, addressed by Microsoft in August and October 2023, include CVE-2023-35384, a bypass for a critical security flaw corrected in March 2023. This vulnerability could lead to escalated privileges and theft of NTLM credentials, allowing for a relay attack. The other flaw, CVE-2023-36710, pertains to the Audio Compression Manager (ACM) component and resulted from an integer overflow vulnerability when playing a WAV file. To prevent such attacks in the future, organizations are recommended to block remote public IP addresses, disable NTLM, or add users to the Protected Users security group.\n",

      "article": "Microsoft has discovered a new wave of phishing attacks distributing QakBot malware, targeting the hospitality industry. The low-volume campaign started on December 11, 2023, where targets received fraudulent PDFs from users pretending to be IRS employees. The PDFs contained a URL link that, when clicked, executed a command leading to QakBot invocation. This payload was generated the same day the campaign started, signalling a potentially new version of the malware. QakBot, or QBot, is a botnet that was previously disrupted in a coordinated effort known as Operation Duck Hunt. Traditionally, QakBot was spread via spam emails, harvesting sensitive information and distributing additional malware such as ransomware. Its return months after being dismantled by law enforcement reflects the endurance of such botnets, emphasizing the need for organizations to maintain vigilance against spam emails used in these phishing campaigns.\n",

      "article": "Four US nationals have been charged for a cryptocurrency investment scam that netted over $80 million. The accused, Lu Zhang, Justin Walker, Joseph Wong, and Hailong Zhu, are charged with multiple counts of money laundering. The group allegedly used shell companies and bank accounts to conduct \"pig butchering scams,\" which involve gaining trust through fictitious online identities and persuading victims to invest in fraudulent schemes. Around $20 million of the victim funds were deposited directly into the defendants' bank accounts. The case comes as US authorities intensify crackdown on such scams, with investment fraud involving cryptocurrencies reaching $2.57 billion in losses in 2022, a 183% rise from the previous year. The scammers often use leaked personal data to identify and target their victims.\n",

      "article": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an alert warning manufacturers of severe risks of default passwords on internet-exposed systems. The agency revealed that Iranian threat actors have exploited these systems to gain access to critical infrastructure. Considered easy targets, devices and appliances that use default passwords allow threat actors to gain root or administrative privileges. CISA recommends manufacturers follow secure design principles and provide unique setup passwords or disable them after a preset period, urging users to use phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. They also advised manufacturers to conduct field tests to observe actual product usage and ensure default system setup leans towards security. Recently, the Israel National Cyber Directorate attributed cyber attacks on their country's infrastructure to Lebanese threat actors linked to the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence.\n",
